Parsing-Algorithms
==================

This folder contains the code for a CKY-style parser given a probabilistic context-free grammar
(PCFG) trained from the Penn Treebank . 
Refer to this paper for more details on the algorithm:
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/courses/nlp2011/notes/pcfgs.pdf

You will need test.txt, toy.pcfg and grammar.pcfg from "probabilistic context free grammar parsing".
